Feasibility survey and marketing are two different approaches used by
 businesses for different purposes.
Feasibility survey refers to a systematic process of assessing the 
viability of a project, product,or service.
It involves analyzing various aspects such as technical,economic,legal,
and social factors to determine the feasibility of a project.
Marketing, on the other hand,is the process of identifying, anticipating
and satisfying customer needs and wants through the creation,
promotion and distribution of products or services.
Furthermore, feasibility surveys tend to be more technical and
data-driven, while marketing often involves creative and strategic
thinking.
A feasibility survey is a preliminary step in the planning process
of a project, while marketing is an ongoing process aimed at
generating sales and revenue for a business.
A feasibility survey report typically consists of a comprehensive
analysis of the data gathered, while marketing reports may contain
 more visual and creative elements.

    PURPOSE:
The purpose of feasibility survey is to assess the viability of a project,
product, or service.
It helps in identifying potential risks and challenges that may arise 
during the implementation of the project.
Feasibility survey also helps in determining the potential return on 
investment and identifying the resources required for the project.
On the other hand, the purpose of marketing is to create, promote, and
distribute products or services to satisfy customer needs and wants.
Marketing involves creating a customer base, developing a brand,and 
creating awareness about the product or service.

   SCCOPE:
The scope of feasibility survey is limited to assessing the viability of a
project, product, or service.
It involves analyzing various aspects such as technical,economic,legal,
and social factors to determine the feasibility of the project.
The scope of feasibility survey is limited to the pre-development phase
of a  project.
On the other hand,the scope of marketing is much broader.It involves
identifyingcustomer needs and wants,creating a product or service that
satisfies those needs and wants, promoting the product or service,and
distributing the product or service to customers.

    TIMEFRAME:
The timeframe of feasibility survey is usually shorter than that of 
marketing.
Feasibility survey is conducted in the pre-development phase of a
project and is usually completed within a few weeks or months.
On the other hand, marketing is an ongoing process that starts with
identifying customer needs and wantsand continues even after the
product or service has been launched in the market.

    DATA COLLECTION:
Feasibility survey involves collecting data from various sources such
as market research reports,government publications,and industry experts. 
The data collected is then analyzed to determine the feasibility of the
project.
On the other hand, marketing involves collecting data from various
sources such as customer surveys, market research reports, and 
sales data. The data collected is used to create a marketing strategy
that satisfies customer needs and wants.

    DECISION-MAKING:
The decision-making process in feasibility survey is focused on 
determining whether the project is viable or not.If the project is
not viable, the project may be cancelled or modified to make it viable.
On the other hand, the decision-making process in marketing is 
focused on creating a marketing strategy that satisfies customer
needs and wants.
The marketing strategy may be modified based on customer feedback
and market conditions.

    Audience:
Feasibility surveys are typically conducted with a specific audience
 in mind, such as potential investors or stakeholders.

informed decision about whether to invest in the project or not.
Marketing, on the other hand, is aimed at a broader audience,
including potential customers and the general public.

    Risks:
Feasibility surveys are conducted to identify potential risks and
challenges associated with the project or idea.
This allows stakeholders to make an informed decision about
whether to proceed with the project or not. Marketing, on the
other hand, involves managing risks associated with branding,
customer engagement, and sales.

a comprehensive business strategy. The data collected during
the feasibility survey can be used to inform marketing 
campaigns, and marketing data can be used to refine

marketing is that feasibility surveys focus on assessing the
viability of aproject or business venture, while marketing
focuses on identifying and satisfying customer needs through
product development, promotion,and distribution.
